    <h3>who i am?</h3>
    <p>
      I am pursuing my Bachelor of Science degree in this College and you can
      trust my <span style="text-decoration: underline">words</span>. <br />
      The College is Average and like other tier 3 Colleges they also focuses
      only on marks rather than practicle knowledge. <br />
      The strenght of my class is only <span style="color: red">25 students</span> yes
      you heard right 25, even i am a computer Science student and the fact is
      that in my class only hardly four to 5 people can code <br />
      we are not taught to learn to code we are taught to meomorize the code.
      I dont know about other stream but this is condition my class
